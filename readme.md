# Voting Graph Portfolio
Create a nice one-page portfolio of the most relevant graphs for a democratic election (parliament elections). This tool is loosly based on german elections. Some rulesets may differ from the reality. This is just a hobby project for practicing data handling and data visualization.

# Goals
## Data Management
* <span style="color: #d9ab23;">in progress</span> import CSV-file with voting results (as absolute numbers) for multiple years
* <span style="color: red;">not started</span> calculating the relative voting numbers
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> compare the percentage difference to last year votings
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> calculating a seat distribution for a parliament according to the relative results
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> take into account a 5%-restriction for minimum vote count 
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> calculate possible coalitions 

## Data Visualization
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> create a bar graph with results
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> create a bar graph with results compared to last year
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> create a bar graph with seat distribution in parliament
* <span style="color: #d8433c;">not started</span> create a visulisation for possible coalitions
