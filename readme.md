# Voting Graph Portfolio
Create a nice one-page portfolio of the most relevant graphs for a democratic election (parliament elections). This tool is loosly based on german elections. Some rulesets may differ from the reality. This is just a hobby project for practicing data handling and data visualization.

# Goals
## Data Management
*  `in progress` import CSV-file with voting results (as absolute numbers) for multiple years
*  calculating the relative voting numbers
*  compare the percentage difference to last year votings
*  calculating a seat distribution for a parliament according to the relative results
*  take into account a 5%-restriction for minimum vote count 
*  calculate possible coalitions
